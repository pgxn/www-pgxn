Revision history for Perl extension WWW-PGXN.

0.13.0  2024-02-17T22:23:29Z
      - Added CI tests for Perls 5.10 - 5.38 on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
      - Fixed test failures caused by line endings on Windows (probably only
        when checked out by Git).
      - Updated relevant URLs from http to https.
      - Modernized Build.PL to comply with CPAN Meta Spec v2.

0.12.4  2013-11-06T05:56:15Z
      - Removed the Pod tests from the distribution.
      - Fixed user agent string so it actually includes the version number.
        This prevents nginx from returning a 400 response.

0.12.3  2012-11-28T01:09:09Z
      - Updated URI::Template to v0.16 for its support for `{+var}` and
        dropped the nasty hack required to work around the lack of it in
        earlier versions.
      - Fixed test failure on Perl 5.17 due to hash order randomization.
